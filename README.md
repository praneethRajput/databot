Information Dissemination Analysis using Natural Language Processing

Abstract â€“ Information dissemination and outreach is a vital indicative parameter of the success of a campaign or broadcast. News and marketing agencies across the world are finding novel ways to reach the target audience through traditional models such as RSS feeds or targeted advertising campaigns. While raw data is no longer a scarce resource, the insights drawn from it is still an evolving field.  We propose to provide a comprehensive visualization of these models and measure them against the public response generated through social media avenues. We propose to utilize open platforms exposed by reputed news agencies [1] across the world along with in house crawler bots to assimilate data. We intend to categorize this data into segments employing Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning to provide measurable insights against actual public response. We propose to employ state of the art visualization techniques to generate heat maps based on content and realize an intelligent platform that further spawns data bots to derive granular insights.
